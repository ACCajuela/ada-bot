Ada Bot is a task manager bot for Discord.
You can create tasks and assign them to roles or users in your server, and Ada will send reminders at the interval you set.
You can also use it as a time tracker and meeting notepad.

Ada Bot was designed to meet our college needs while applying the Kanban Method.
Feel free to contribute to her development.

Sincerely,
Team Lovelace
